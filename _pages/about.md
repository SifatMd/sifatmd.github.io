Hi! I'm Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, a 5th year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/). I am currently interning at Hewlett Packard (HP) Labs as a Machine Learning Research Associate, working on enhancing the efficiency of LLM fine-tuning, adapting LLMs for diverse applications, and advancing their reasoning capabilities. At Virginia Tech, I am advised by [Dr. Bimal Viswanath](https://people.cs.vt.edu/vbimal/). My research interests center around the security & reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and LLMs. Particularly, I focus on analyzing and enhancing the robustness of Multimodal and Large Language models against adversarial attacks, and leverage inference-time reasoning to make them safer against real-world threats. I have received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [BUET](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) in April, 2019. 

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
