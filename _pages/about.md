Hi! I'm Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, a 3rd year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/). Working under the supervision of [Dr. Bimal Viswanath](https://people.cs.vt.edu/vbimal/), my research interests center around security of generative models. Particularly, I focus on uncovering the vulnerabilities of deepfake content detectors using foundation models and developing more robust and generalizable methods for their detection. I have received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [BUET](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) in April, 2019. 

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
